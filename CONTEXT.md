# Frontend Integration Context

This context captures the domain language for the desktop capture app so architecture discussions use stable project terms.

## Language

**Screen Frame Artifact**:
A just-produced native capture output that has not yet been persisted into app-infra.
Screen frame artifacts are currently written as JPEG files.
_Avoid_: captured frame, transient screenshot, raw frame record

**Captured Frame Pipeline**:
A persisted flow for a captured screen frame from intake through batch attachment, OCR planning, and batch-finalization readiness.
_Avoid_: frame processing service, frame ingestion component, OCR pipeline

**Captured Frame**:
A screen image captured during a recording session and persisted as frame metadata plus a file path. A **Captured Frame** is the stored database-backed record, not the just-produced native artifact.
_Avoid_: screenshot, image record

**Frame Batch**:
A time-windowed group of captured frames for one recording session.
_Avoid_: bucket, chunk, frame group

**OCR Job**:
A processing job that recognizes text for one captured frame.
_Avoid_: processor task, recognition work item

**Captured Frame Reprocessing**:
A request to re-run OCR for an existing **Captured Frame** that is already persisted.
_Avoid_: force processing, rerun pipeline, requeue screenshot

**Recording Lifecycle**:
The in-memory control flow for one coordinated recording runtime that starts capture, owns pause/resume decisions, rotates segments, recovers after wake, and stops capture across the requested sources. Screen and system audio share the screen capture backend, while microphone runs as a separate native session.
_Avoid_: capture runtime, recorder service, session manager

**Audio Segment**:
A time-bounded persisted audio recording file produced from one recording source during a recording session.
_Avoid_: audio file, raw microphone file, sound clip

**Audio Transcription**:
Recognized speech text, with optional timing relative to its **Audio Segment**, language, confidence, provider, and model metadata, derived from one **Audio Segment**.
_Avoid_: transcript blob, transcription result, speech text

**Audio Transcription Job**:
Background work that recognizes speech for one **Audio Segment**.
_Avoid_: transcription task, transcript worker item, speech job

**Audio Transcription Provider**:
A local speech recognition option used by an **Audio Transcription Job** to produce an **Audio Transcription**.
_Avoid_: cloud transcription service, transcription engine, ASR backend

**Audio Transcription Model**:
A local model asset selected for an **Audio Transcription Provider** when that provider requires app-managed model files.
_Avoid_: model file, downloaded artifact, checkpoint

**Captured Frame Equivalence**:
The rule for when two **Captured Frame** values should be treated as the same OCR-relevant visual content for downstream decisions such as **OCR Job** admission. **Captured Frame Equivalence** is defined over normalized visual content rather than persisted artifact bytes, and intentionally ignores cursor-sized changes plus limited localized visual noise that does not materially change OCR-relevant content.
_Avoid_: dedupe hash, screenshot sameness, OCR skip heuristic

**Captured Frame Equivalence Scope**:
The rule for where an earlier equivalent **Captured Frame** may be searched when applying **Captured Frame Equivalence**. **Captured Frame Equivalence Scope** is session-wide by default, but narrows to the same hidden segment workspace when the candidate **Captured Frame** originated from a hidden segment workspace artifact path.
_Avoid_: workspace filter, lookup scope, same-segment rule

**Hidden Segment Workspace**:
A hidden per-segment directory (`.<session>-segment-####/`) that stores temporary capture artifacts and exported JPEG frames for one screen segment. A **Hidden Segment Workspace** lives beside its visible sibling segment recording file.
_Avoid_: temp folder, segment scratch dir, hidden segment temp

**Hidden Segment Workspace Repair**:
The scan-and-cleanup flow that classifies a **Hidden Segment Workspace** using **Frame Batch** references, **OCR Job** references, whether the visible sibling segment is present and openable, pending frame artifacts, and whether the workspace is still the active screen session before deciding whether it is safe to remove.
_Avoid_: temp cleanup, workspace GC, segment dir sweep

**Managed Storage Layout**:
The derived on-disk layout rooted at `<saveDirectory>` that owns app-infra state such as SQLite and the recordings tree.
_Avoid_: save dir helper, path utility, storage paths

**Audio Activity Sample**:
A raw audio probe reading such as latest normalized level or last-sample timestamp, exposed for debug visibility but not itself used as the inactivity decision.
_Avoid_: audio activity event, microphone activity, system audio activity

**Audio Activity Decision**:
The threshold-qualified inactivity-policy view of audio activity, including enabled state, threshold, and derived idle used for pause/resume decisions.
_Avoid_: raw audio sample, activity reading, latest level

## Relationships

- A **Screen Frame Artifact** becomes a **Captured Frame** only after app-infra persists it.
- A **Captured Frame Pipeline** persists one **Captured Frame**.
- A **Captured Frame Pipeline** attaches each **Captured Frame** to exactly one **Frame Batch**.
- A **Captured Frame Pipeline** may enqueue one **OCR Job** for a **Captured Frame**.
- A **Recording Lifecycle** coordinates screen, microphone, and system-audio capture within one recording runtime.
- A **Recording Lifecycle** may pause or resume requested sources based on inactivity policy.
- A **Recording Lifecycle** commits requested audio sources as **Audio Segment** values.
- An **Audio Segment** comes from exactly one recording source, such as microphone or system audio.
- A microphone **Audio Segment** becomes eligible for an **Audio Transcription Job** when the **Recording Lifecycle** commits it, even if the eventual transcript is empty.
- An **Audio Transcription Job** operates on exactly one **Audio Segment**.
- An **Audio Transcription Job** uses exactly one **Audio Transcription Provider**.
- V1 **Audio Transcription Provider** values are local-only: `local_whisper`, `apple_speech_on_device`, and `parakeet`.
- V1 `local_whisper` **Audio Transcription Model** choices are `tiny`, `base`, `small`, and `medium`, with `base` as the default.
- V1 `parakeet` uses `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx` as its **Audio Transcription Model** and runs it through the Rust ONNX Runtime adapter.
- `apple_speech_on_device` uses OS-managed language models rather than an app-managed **Audio Transcription Model**.
- An **Audio Transcription Provider** may require one selected **Audio Transcription Model**.
- A microphone **Audio Segment** gets one **Audio Transcription Job** for the selected **Audio Transcription Provider** when that provider and its required **Audio Transcription Model** are available.
- An **Audio Transcription Job** freezes the selected **Audio Transcription Provider** and **Audio Transcription Model** at admission time.
- Changing the selected **Audio Transcription Provider** or **Audio Transcription Model** affects future **Audio Segment** values, not existing completed **Audio Transcription** values.
- An app-managed **Audio Transcription Model** may be installed, missing, downloading, or failed.
- If the selected **Audio Transcription Provider** or required **Audio Transcription Model** is unavailable, the microphone **Audio Segment** remains eligible but does not get an **Audio Transcription Job** until backfill can enqueue it.
- Missing selected **Audio Transcription Model** status is surfaced when recording starts and in a dedicated Transcription settings surface, not once per committed microphone **Audio Segment**.
- An **Audio Transcription** is derived from exactly one **Audio Segment**.
- An empty no-speech **Audio Transcription** is a successful **Audio Transcription**, not a failed job.
- An **Audio Transcription** is produced by an **Audio Transcription Job**.
- A **Managed Storage Layout** is derived from one `saveDirectory` value.
- A **Managed Storage Layout** contains the recordings tree under `<saveDirectory>/recordings`.
- **Captured Frame Equivalence** determines whether a new **Captured Frame** needs a new **OCR Job**.
- **Captured Frame Equivalence Scope** determines which earlier **Captured Frame** values are eligible comparison candidates.
- A **Captured Frame Pipeline** skips a new **OCR Job** when an earlier equivalent **Captured Frame** in the same session is already eligible as the OCR fallback.
- A **Frame Batch** can be finalized only after its **OCR Job** entries are terminal.
- **Captured Frame Reprocessing** operates on an existing **Captured Frame**, not on a new **Screen Frame Artifact**.
- A **Hidden Segment Workspace** may be preserved when an incomplete **Frame Batch** or nonterminal **OCR Job** still references it.
- **Hidden Segment Workspace Repair** removes only **Hidden Segment Workspace** values that are safe to remove.
- An **Audio Activity Sample** can inform an **Audio Activity Decision**, but the two are not interchangeable.
- An **Audio Activity Decision** is what the inactivity policy uses to pause or resume capture.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a **Captured Frame** is equivalent to an earlier frame in the same session, does the **Captured Frame Pipeline** still create an **OCR Job**?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — the frame is persisted and attached to its **Frame Batch**, but if an earlier equivalent frame is already eligible, the pipeline reuses that OCR fallback instead of creating another **OCR Job**."

> **Dev:** "Is `microphoneActivityLastUnixMs` the same thing as the audio signal the inactivity policy uses?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — that timestamp is an **Audio Activity Sample**; the inactivity pause logic uses an **Audio Activity Decision** derived from threshold-qualified activity."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "pipeline" previously meant both frame intake and OCR execution; resolved: **Captured Frame Pipeline** means frame intake through batch-finalization readiness, while **OCR Job** means the recognition work for one frame.
- "audio activity" previously referred to both raw probe output and inactivity-policy state; resolved: raw probe output is an **Audio Activity Sample**, while policy-facing threshold-qualified state is an **Audio Activity Decision**.
- "audio file" was used to mean the persisted unit for transcription; resolved: use **Audio Segment** for the time-bounded persisted recording file.
- "provider" was considered for both cloud and local transcription services; resolved: **Audio Transcription Provider** means local-only for v1.
